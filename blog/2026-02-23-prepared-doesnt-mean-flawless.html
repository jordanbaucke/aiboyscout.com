            <p><strong>🏕️ 21st Century Digital Boy Scout – Edition</strong></p>

            <p>Before I begin: while this piece is often listed on Harvard Business Review as “Subscriber Only” content, it has been widely republished online since its original publication in 2014.</p>

            <p>My partner, Liz Duty, shared the article with me. I wasn’t surprised to learn it’s over a decade old — and still relevant. As a straight white male, I’m aware I can feel a bit of imposter syndrome commenting on issues tied to other genders and lived experiences. I’m approaching this with humility and curiosity. 🙏</p>

            <p>The article: <a href="https://hbr.org/2014/08/why-women-dont-apply-for-jobs-unless-theyre-100-qualified" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Why Women Don’t Apply for Jobs Unless They’re 100% Qualified”</a> by <a href="https://www.taramohr.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tara Sophia Mohr</a>.</p>

            <p>I encourage everyone to follow <a href="https://www.taramohr.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tara Sophia Mohr</a> and explore her work directly: <a href="https://www.taramohr.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.taramohr.com</a>!</p>

            <p>One line from her research stood out to me:</p>

            <p>“I didn’t think they would hire me since I didn’t meet the qualifications and I didn’t want to put myself out there if I was likely to fail.” These women also believed the on-paper “rules” about who the job was for, but for them, the cost of applying was the risk of failure – rather than the wasted time and energy. Notably, only 13% of men cited not wanting to try and fail as their top reason.</p>

            <p><strong>The issue isn’t confidence. It’s an interpretation of qualifications.</strong> 🫆🔬</p>

            <p>Men tend to apply when they meet ~60% of the criteria.</p>
            <p>Women tend to apply only when they meet ~100%.</p>
            <p>That’s not about ability. 🧠💪🏻</p>
            <p>It’s about how we read the rules. 🔖</p>

            <p>As a former Boy Scout, I was taught to be “Prepared.” 🇺🇸</p>
            <p>But there’s a subtle difference between being prepared… and waiting until you are perfectly prepared.</p>
            <p>Perfection can quietly become a gatekeeper.</p>

            <p>Recently, I referred a female friend for a role. I think very highly of her skills and am confident she would perform well. I mentioned she might need to brush up in one specific area.</p>
            <p>Her response:</p>
            <p>“I have no experience in that!”</p>
            <p>Not “I can learn it.”</p>
            <p>Not “I’ll ramp up.”</p>
            <p>Just an immediate disqualification. 🤯</p>

            <p>It made me pause.</p>

            <p>In the technology world — especially in AI and software engineering — job descriptions often read like wish lists. 10 frameworks. 5 clouds. 12 APIs. A PhD would help. 🤯🎓</p>

            <p>But building systems in the real world rarely requires 100% compliance with a bullet list. It requires curiosity, adaptability, and integrity. 🧠</p>

            <p>In <a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/the-confidence-code-katty-kayclaire-shipman" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“The Confidence Code,”</a> <a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/blogs/authors/katty-kay-48335" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Katty Kay</a> and <a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/blogs/authors/claire-shipman-880000043495" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Claire Shipman</a> argue that confidence grows through action, not before it.</p>

            <p>That resonates with me.</p>
            <p>You don’t wait to feel ready. 😟</p>
            <p>You move, and readiness catches up. 🏃🏻</p>

            <p>From a constitutional lens 🇺🇸:</p>
            <p>Opportunity is foundational to a free society. If qualified people self-select out because they interpret requirements as rigid barriers, we all lose talent.</p>

            <p>As someone building AI tools and working in emerging technology, I think about this a lot.</p>
            <p>AI systems interpret tokens literally. 🤖💾</p>
            <p>Humans sometimes do the same with job descriptions.</p>
            <p>We see: “Required.” ✅</p>
            <p>And translate it to: “Unless you are perfect, do not proceed.” 😩</p>

            <p>Maybe a healthier framing is:</p>
            <p>“Here’s what would be helpful. Show us how you think.”</p>

            <p>If you're 60% aligned and growing? Apply.</p>
            <p>If you're 80% aligned and learning? Apply.</p>
            <p>If you're 100% aligned? You might already be overqualified.</p>

            <p><strong>Prepared doesn’t mean flawless.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>It means willing.</strong> 💪🏻</p>
